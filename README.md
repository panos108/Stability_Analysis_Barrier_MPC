# Stability_Analysis_Barrier_MPC
This repo contains the work regarding the stability analysis of Barrier MPC. IQCs with both static and dynamic multipliers are developed and appropriate convex searches for the multipliers are presented. The details of this work can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03154 (Accepted in Transcaction on Automatic Control)
